This is an implementation of Obj Mesh loader. Part of it is borrowed from https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader

It reads in an obj file and obj mtl file.
It builds vertex buffers and index buffers for loaded meshes
It reads in the textures and builds texture Buffers
It binds all the resources for a mesh and issues drawcalls
It also implements camera controls using keyboard

How to use:
ColoredTriangleDemo.h has function definitions- Copy paste in your code
ColoredTriangleDemo.cpp has function implementations- Copy paste in your code
Include objMeshLoader header in your code

What doesnt work (TODO):
Texcoords are not bound correctly since obj format uses indexing differently for textures
