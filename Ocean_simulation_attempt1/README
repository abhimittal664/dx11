First attempt for simulation ocean (in wireframe mode) using previously uploaded ObjMeshLoader and a flat grid
Equation used is:
y1 = A1 . sin (k1x -w1t) for x dir wave
y2 = A2 . sin (k2z - w2t) for z dir wave
y_final = y1 + y2;

Runtime controls:
Q,E,W,S,A,D for Camera movements
R to reset camera and wave parameters
Y,H to increase/decrease k  (both waves together)
U,J to increase/decrease w  (both waves together)
I,K to increase/decrease A  (both waves together)
